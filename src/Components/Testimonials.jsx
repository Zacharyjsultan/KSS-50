          Keely, You are wonderful at what you do. The reiki session I had with
          you was revealing and healing. I hope to book a session with you again
          soon! -Lori

            As a mom who needs a space to just be and allow relaxation and
            restoration set in, Keely provides a wonderful space. She also
            helped clear a few blocks I had. I especially enjoyed the presence
            Keely brings, the ambiance and details to the space, and the flow of
            the Reiki session. It was wonderful, and I will book again soon.

            1 hour with Keely and it was like years of stuckness were gently and
            lovingly released. She has a true gift of returning flow and
            connection from within. Thank you, Keely! -Erica
