          "Being new parents comes with a lot of responsibility, anxiety and
          unknowns. Having Keely be at our sides throughout the birth process
          was everything our little family needed. Keely was thoughtful,
          informative professional and intentional in how she worked with us
          leading up to our son’s birth, and amazing the day of. She was calm,
          cool and collected as she worked with both mom and dad along with the
          hospital staff throughout our entire birth experience. It was both an
          intense yet magical experience made better with Keely’s guidance and
          support. We would highly recommend working with Keely as your birth
          doula." - Israel, Lauren and Sauvie

          " Keely changed the course of our pregnancy towards an experience of
          trust and confidence. We are eternally grateful to her for being a
          source of care and wisdom throughout the pregnancy and beyond. Keely
          has a beautiful quality about her that allows her to care for subtle
          needs that have big reverberations in the pregnancy journey. For us,
          she was a doula to the birth of our son but also to the birth of an
          entirely new phase of life for our entire family. Because she provided
          so much acknowledgement of our individual transformations and because
          she made us aware of needs we couldn't have anticipated (such as deep
          care for our transformations in marriage as well as specific birthing
          preferences), we were then able to experience what we now understand
          as a truly perfect birthing process. Though many things did not go
          exactly as we had anticipated, it was Keely's support that allowed us
          to trust the process and know that we were in good hands with her by
          our side. We highly recommend Keely for birthing women and families.
          Know that when you bring Keely into the process you will experience
          care on deep personal levels and coordinated/practical levels that
          enrich and strengthen the birthing process." - Erica, Ken and Octavio
