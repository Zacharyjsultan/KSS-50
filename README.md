I want to provide birth services for pregnant people and their families. Includes prenatal meetings, continuous in person support during birth and several follow up postpartum visits. I want to provide Reiki sessions to the general public and for birthing people and their families. I will also include various somatic practices throughout meetings. I want to provide safe supportive energy to all my clients
My goals for this site are to put my name out there to the energy healing and birth communities, have families and individuals easily access me and my information to book appointments and learn more about me and my background
I want my site to portray simplicity, safety, calm, soothing uplifting energy
My target audience would be those seeking a deeper connection with self, those from the spiritual community, those exhausted or defeated by western medicine approaches to birth or healing, wanting alternatives to healing/ more holistic methods
What makes me different is my background working with kids with developmental disabilities, experience in crisis situations, my own personal journey of finding different healing modalities to help with ptsd, anxiety etc. the trauma informed trainings i’ve taken
Im not sure what the scope of the project means, but setting up a simple perhaps one or two page website and business cards
Core values- integrity, respect of individuals autonomy and whole personhood, meeting someone where they are at, just as they are, safety, loyalty
On the website i would like clients to be able to get my contact information, what services i provide and pricing and background information about me
Pieces of key info: pricing, how they can reach me, free consultation, perhaps a few pics? Reviews from some clients?

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:s

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
