## mission statemment 01/2024

My mission is to provide holistic birth doula care that is person-centered, trauma informed and evidence based. I aim to provide a space and tools for all kinds of families and individuals to feel empowered by listening to their own intuitive wisdom and deeper knowing. I believe all healing is self healing, and you are the expert of your body. As a Reiki practitioner I am a witness, supporter and facilitator of your healing journey.

Being new parents comes with a lot of responsibility, anxiety and unknowns. Having Keely be at our sides throughout the birth process was everything our little family needed.

Keely was thoughtful, informative professional and intentional in how she worked with us leading up to our son’s birth, and amazing the day of. She was calm, cool and collected as she worked with both mom and dad along with the hospital staff throughout our entire birth experience. It was both an intense yet magical experience made better with Keely’s guidance and support. We would highly recommend working with Keely as your birth doula.

Keely has a gentle and intuitive approach to this energy work. Her feedback has helped me feel more grounded and more certain in what my body needs.
-Kelly

Before speaking with Keely, I was reticent about Reiki. I have anxiety and ADHD and it is very difficult for me to just relax. I had practiced yoga, meditation, and many other forms of mindfulness to no avail - so why would Reiki be any different? But from the start, Keely made me feel so comfortable with the entirsase process and helped me get into a headspace where I could actually experience the calming benefits. For the first time in my life, I was able to truly be mindful - and it is because of Keely's expertise in her practice as well as her comforting and positive presence. I've also experienced physical health issues recently that have made it very important for me to establish a stronger and more accurate mind/body connection. Knowing this need, Keely has been able to focus our sessions around that connection. I am healing both physically and emotionally from the trauma of my injuries, and no small part of that is the work that Keely has been doing with me. I cannot recommend her and her services enough.

Keely changed the course of our pregnancy towards an experience of trust and confidence. We are eternally grateful to her for being a source of care and wisdom throughout the pregnancy and beyond. Keely has a beautiful quality about her that allows her to care for subtle needs that have big reverberations in the pregnancy journey. For us, she was a doula to the birth of our son but also to the birth of an entirely new phase of life for our entire family. Because she provided so much acknowledgement of our individual transformations and because she made us aware of needs we couldn't have anticipated (such as deep care for our transformations in marriage as well as specific birthing preferences), we were then able to experience what we now understand as a truly perfect birthing process. Though many things did not go exactly as we had anticipated, it was Keely's support that allowed us to trust the process and know that we were in good hands with her by our side.

We highly recommend Keely for birthing women and families. Know that when you bring Keely into the process you will experience care on deep personal levels and coordinated/practical levels that enrich and strengthen the birthing process.

With deepest appreciation,

Erica, Ken, and baby Octavio :

I want to provide birth services for pregnant people and their families. Includes prenatal meetings, continuous in person support during birth and several follow up postpartum visits. I want to provide Reiki sessions to the general public and for birthing people and their families. I will also include various somatic practices throughout meetings. I want to provide safe supportive energy to all my clients
My goals for this site are to put my name out there to the energy healing and birth communities, have families and individuals easily access me and my information to book appointments and learn more about me and my background
I want my site to portray simplicity, safety, calm, soothing uplifting energy
My target audience would be those seeking a deeper connection with self, those from the spiritual community, those exhausted or defeated by western medicine approaches to birth or healing, wanting alternatives to healing/ more holistic methods
What makes me different is my background working with kids with developmental disabilities, experience in crisis situations, my own personal journey of finding different healing modalities to help with ptsd, anxiety etc. the trauma informed trainings i’ve taken
Im not sure what the scope of the project means, but setting up a simple perhaps one or two page website and business cards
Core values- integrity, respect of individuals autonomy and whole personhood, meeting someone where they are at, just as they are, safety, loyalty
On the website i would like clients to be able to get my contact information, what services i provide and pricing and background information about me
Pieces of key info: pricing, how they can reach me, free consultation, perhaps a few pics? Reviews from some clients?

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:s

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

asd

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
